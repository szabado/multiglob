Inspired by a problem I encountered at work, this matches a string against a list of patterns and tells you which
one it matched against!

This uses a Radix tree under the hood and aims to be pretty darn fast.

## Usage:

See under `/example` for the usage, but it's copied below.

```
func main() {
	mgb := multiglob.New()
	mgb.MustAddPattern("foo", "foo*")
	mgb.MustAddPattern("bar", "bar*")
	mgb.MustAddPattern("eyyyy!", "*ey*")

	mg := mgb.MustCompile()

	if mg.Match("football") {
		fmt.Println("I matched!")
	}

	matches := mg.FindAllPatterns("barney stinson")
	if matches == nil {
		fmt.Println("Oh no, I didn't match any pattern")
		return
	}

	for _, match := range matches {
		fmt.Println("I matched: ", match)
	}
}
```

## Performance Comparison

The lazy way you can do what multiglob does is loop over the patterns. That's _sloooow_, but I wanted
to know how slow. I benchmarked it against the standard library `regexp` package as well as 
[github.com/gobwas/glob](https://github.com/gobwas/glob), which I took some inspiration from.
On my laptop, the benchmarks in `comparison_test.go` produce this:

```
$ go test . -bench=.                                                                                                                                                                                                          [0]

All the `Multi` benchmarks are matching one string across a bunch of patterns, and all the `Single` one are
one pattern. Basically? It's **fast**. It's more then 10 times faster than Glob, and that ratio gets better the
more patterns there are.

Based on the benchmark, it also has better performance growth than Glob.
The Multi tests have 720 patterns, and MultiGlob took ~150 times longer to execute the Multi tests compared to
Glob's ~190 times increase.

Glob is already _way_ faster than using a Regex. MultiGlob is _way_ faster than doing
using Glob naively; you just have to accept the reduced functionality.

### Open Questions


## Isn't this basically an http router??

Yep! But I didn't want the overhead of `http` and I wanted to write this for fun.

## Limitations

This only supports wildcards `*`. If you need more, I'd suggest checking out [glob](https://github.com/gobwas/glob).

## Requirements

This requires >= Go 1.11, in order to use the modules. You can _probably_ vendor it in with older versions,
but as always do so at your own risk.
